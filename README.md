# MALARIA-CELLS-PARASITE-CLASSIFIER-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
In this project, I've trained a deep learning model to classify and localize the parasites present in the blood smeared images which are seen under microscope.

Dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria)

FASTAI PRETRAINED MODELS USED.
-VGG19_BN Accuracy --> 97.68 %
